:woman_technologist: I created this site from-scratch to practice the following skills:
* CSS Grid
* Responsive development/design

> See deployed site [here.](https://dayna-schlenk.github.io/css-grid-tutorial-practice/)

*The resources I used are included in the site's navigation menu, along with the mini-projects that were built from those tutorials.*
